Discord  Bot to set up #looking-for-group channel.  
This simple bot will let you set up separate lfg channel, and then send event messages to show that you are looking for a group. Several lfg channels are supported as well.
All messages, which are not commands from [existing commands list](#existing-commands) will be deleted immediately.  
Commands will be deleted right after processing.  
To accept or decline event, a user can click on üëç or üëé emoji respectively.  
All other reactions will be deleted to prevent reaction spam and trolling.  

## Existing commands
List of available commands:
- `lfg help` - get info about bot and list of existing commands
- `lfg setup` - make this channel an lfg channel. The bot will only react to messages in the lfg channel. Requires user to have 'Manage Channels' permission.
- `lfg ignore [message]` - add a message to the lfg channel. Other messages (ignoring commands) will be deleted immediately from lfg channel. Example: `lfg ignore This message is introductory thus should not be deleted` Requires user to have 'Manage Channels' permission.
- `lfg moderate #{channel} [0/1]` - enable/disable moderation mod for the lfg channel. If disabled, messages that does not contain listed commands will not be deleted. `#{channel}` - tag your lfg channel instead of this. Example: `lfg moderate #lfg 0` will disable moderation of the lfg channel, while `lfg moderate #lfg 1` will turn it back. Make sure you don't have extra spacebars in command, otherwise bot will not be able to parse it properly. Requires user to have 'Manage Channels' permission.
- `lfg start` - add lfg message to the lfg channel. New temp channel will be created, where the user will be prompted to complete the survey. User's answers will be collected into an embed and sent to the lfg channel.

## If you found a bug
If you have any issue with the bot functionality, feel free to post an issue in this repo - for now, I am intended to maintain this app as long as I don't feel it is stable enough.

## Need any adjustments?
If you feel some cool feature is missing, or you want to make some minor tweaks just for your quality of life - feel free to either post an issue in the repo or make a fork and adjust it yourself as you see fit.  
Please bear in mind: I intend to leave this bot single-purpose, meaning I won't add features which are not related to the idea of managing lfg channels.
